## Welcome to the Fearless Data Practice's first capability project!

We will be working on building a image classification model that will be able to reliably distinguish between real images and AI generated images.

My vision for this capability is that eventually, we can have a performant model to deploy in an application to be used to detect AI generated images.

Practical applications could be using this for: <br>
* Detecting fraudulent images being used for authentication/verification.
* Detecting images that may violate an organization's policy of not allowing use of AI generated images.
* Feel free to add more use cases in this list!

You can read the [Hugging Face Competition Page](https://huggingface.co/spaces/competitions/aiornot) for more context about the problem space.
